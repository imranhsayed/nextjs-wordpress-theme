### WordPress Setup
* Download, Upload and activate all the plugins from wordpress/plugins folder of this repo, into your WordPress Site.

1. [wp-graphql](https://github.com/imranhsayed/nextjs-wordpress-theme/blob/master/wordpress/plugins/wp-graphql.zip) - tested on ( v1.0.0 )
2. [Headless CMS](https://github.com/imranhsayed/nextjs-wordpress-theme/blob/master/wordpress/plugins/headless-cms.zip)

# Development

```shell script
npm run dev # Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode
npm run build # Runs next build which builds the application for production usage
npm run start # Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server
```

# [Cypress Tests](https://docs.cypress.io/)

To run cypress locally we run `cypress-open`
It adds a `cypress` directory and some example test in `cypress/integrations`

```shell script
npm run cypress:open
```

* Cypress docs
1. [API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html)

## Debugging with Node.js debugger tool. 
Notice that we have added this in `package.json`
```shell script
"dev": "NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next",
```
when you run `npm run dev`, you will see a node js icon in the Chrome inspector tab and there will also be a url to access it on the terminal
that says `Debugger listeing on ...`

## Important concepts

1. [Prerendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering)
2. Querying blocks:
[WP GraphQL Gutenberg](https://github.com/imranhsayed/nextjs-wordpress-theme/blob/master/wordpress/plugins/wp-graphql-gutenberg-0.3.4.zip) allows you to query Gutenberg blocks.
If you want to break down the blocks and render the content using individual React components, here is the query example.

```shell script
{
  posts {
    nodes {
      title
      blocks {
        name
        innerBlocks {
          name
          saveContent
        }
        saveContent
      }
    }
  }
}
```
